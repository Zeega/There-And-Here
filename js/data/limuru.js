			"description": "In Paterson, New Jersey, there is a recently opened Kenyan community gathering point called /'Uhuru Garden/'. It is a restaurant, a club as well as a conference venue for both official and informal diaspora meetings.  With their authentic recipes and ingredients imported from Kenya, Uhuru Garden is one of the very few places near New York/New Jersey that brings homeliness to the Kenyan immigrants around the area. Back home in Kenya - where authentic ingredients are from - agriculture is becoming ubiquitous thanks to the emerging virtual market place. One day in Limuru, Central Kenya, small farmers organized a field day, registering themselves to companies like /'Uza-Mazao/'; a virtual market place that helps the farmers to establish stable earnings via direct SMS communication with buyers across the world. Nairobi based filmmakers /'Slum-TV/' visited the field day to document how this works.",
