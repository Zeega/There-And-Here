			"description": "Located in central Senegal, Touba is a rapidly growing 2,000,000-people city. It was founded in 1887 by Amadu BÃ mba, a Muslim Sufi religious leader also founder of the large Mouride brotherhood. Mostly confined to Senegal until the end of the Second World War, the brotherhood experienced an important outmigratory movement from the Holy City of Touba that sent Mouride disciples first to the other cities of Senegal and Africa, and then to Europe and the US. Through a rigorous work ethic, Mourides have retained their financial and religious independence and have become known as small-time international businessmen. They are famous for their entrepreneurship as much as for their moderate, essentially African, vision of Islam. Expatriates Mourides are mainly active in the service sector and gains from these international activities are remitted to Touba. As a result, Touba can be considered central node in an alternative global network.",
