One of the most commonly shared cultural marker is that of cuisine. Mexican immigrants in particular have influenced greatly the food palette of America with the tasty culture of the taco truck. Not only have they made the taco and other dishes mainstays of our culture, but they have brightened streets and imaginations, particularly in LA, with the colorful murals that adorn their trucks. These murals often depict images of their hometown, sharing with passerbys and customers a little history and knowledge along with their tacos.",

Instead, fathers have been sending kids and mothers to the U.S. for EDUCATION as the remittance while staying back in Korea and making money to support them.

In 70's and 80's Koreans struggled to earn money by sending miners and nurses to Germany, sent army to Vietnam and took any economic benefit from them. However, things changed. Even though many Koreans are making a living in the States, their money is largely spent in the States and significant number of parents sent their children with huge amount of tuition fee for their education. This research project is for address how things have been changed by time goes by and what is happening around Koreans in New York, especially in Manhattan. ",

It was founded in 1887 by Amadu Bàmba, a Muslim Sufi religious leader also founder of the large Mouride brotherhood. Mostly confined to Senegal until the end of the Second World War, the brotherhood experienced an important out migratory movement from the Holy City of Touba that sent Mouride disciples first to the other cities of Senegal and Africa, and then to Europe and the US. Through a rigorous work ethic, Mourides have retained their financial and religious independence and have become known as small&#45;time international businessmen. They are famous for their entrepreneurship as much as for their moderate, essentially African, vision of Islam. Expatriates Mourides are mainly active in the service sector and gains from these international activities are remitted to Touba. As a result, Touba can be considered central node in an alternative global network.",
