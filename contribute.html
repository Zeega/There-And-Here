  		Building on "Terre Natale: Exits," "Here + There" is a project about telling the stories of remittances. Using remittances data, census data, field visits, and interviews, we are working to understand this phenomenon and its spatial manifestations in New York City, and its paired location elsewhere — sometimes rural, sometimes urban.</br></br>

This project focuses, not just on New York City, but rather on Global Cities and their Transnationalism and Migration. We will look closely at local instantiations of global phenomena: how does transnationalism reveal itself in local ways and what does it means for pairs of nations through individual storytelling.</br></br>

To facilitate our storytelling, locally and globally, we have the exciting opportunity to experiment with a new open-source platform for both mapping and storytelling — ZEEGA. Zeega makes it easy to collaboratively produce, curate and publish participatory multimedia projects online, on mobile devices and in physical spaces, illustrating local instantiations of global issues. For more information about Zeega, see this article from <a href="http://www.pbs.org/idealab/2011/08/zeega-enables-communities-to-create-interactive-documentaries-new-forms-of-storytelling230.html">PBS</a>.
